# Welcome To My Repository
 - Welcome To my MAGD 150 Journey
 - These are some of the Labs That I created In this Class
 - Some of them had more effort than the others
 - I chose these labs to display how simple I started and how I shaped it into better things
 - Below are the labs



## Lab 6
 - This Lab was about Retro Games and largely focused on classes
 - This Lab I made was about pong because I thought It would be fun and easy to code, I was wrong about it being easy
 - I still really enjoyed this lab

## Lab 1 
 - This was our very first lab It was very simple but still I like the way it looked and it was largely about shapes
 - I had to make buildings so I chose a New York esque look
 - Once I compleated it I thought that it looked a bit goofy but I still liked it

## Lab 2
  - This lab was largely about color composition to which our theme was space
  - I made some strange solar flare lines because I thought it gave a better effect
  - It does look goofy but I like the idea of it plus I made a dinky little rocket

## Lab 3 
  - This lab was largely about math with the theme of bubbles
  - The image itself came out quite nicely, inlcuding the moving ball in the middle, I made the bubbles change color to represent the shiny rainbow eque imagery that normal bubbles posses

## Lab 4
  - This lab was largely about Dynamism with the theme of pizza
  - This lab came out looking like a pizza with a box in the background orginally I wanted it to say PIZZA-PASTA but I removed it afterward
  - I could no get parts of to work hence the big block in the corner
